# QOSF_screening_task
This is my submission for the QOSF screening. 

I have only used IBM's QISKIT library to complete the task. 
I have attempted Task 2. 

Please open the file named 'Task2 experiment.ipynb'. Note there are some issues with rendering user defined macros on Github, and I strongly urge the reader to download the entire repository and run the jupyter notebook locally.
